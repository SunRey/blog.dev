## My Laravel MVC Blog

This is my blog written in PHP, JS, JQuery, and CSS on thr Laravel framework

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository
- Create a database for this application
- Create a `.env.local.php` file inside of the `blog.dev/`
- Add the contents of the `env-template.php` to `.env.local.php`
- Add your database logins to the values 
- Run `composer install`

I have used the MVC pattern to create this site.
